Wireframe Ideas
1. Header and Footer Style from Brody
2. Be able to click on small product image to get more information, such as in Christopher's wireframe draft.
3. Be able to scroll through different categories with cursor. See Kalana's example. This may be more of a mobile feature. Consider developing primarily for mobile.
4. Have a special page for educators. See Kalana's example.
